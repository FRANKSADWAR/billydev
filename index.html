          My Set of skills range from Web GIS development, Geospatial database management, Spatial statistics, remote sensing,

          <h2>GIS Web Development</h2>
          <p>
            From location information, web GIS tools are gaining foot due to their usability and flexibility. Geospatial analysis can now be brought
            into the web using open source tools and proprietary tools. 
          </p>

          <h2>Spatial Statistics</h2>
          <p>
            Spatial statistics and econometrics involves discovering patterns in geospatial data and suing inferential technique to identify 
            hidden structure in data. With this technique, you can be able to know why a certain phenomena is occuring at a certain place and 
            why it's only at that location. Bsusinesses and organizations use these techniques to discover patterns such as consumer behavior, disease
            spread, crime hotspots etc.

          <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
          <p>
            With your data, I can deploy algorithms and optimize them to make computers learn from the 
            data and turn it into knowledge. I will utilize these powerful algorithms to make predictions
            for your business needs and predict future events. Machine learning offers insights and improves on the
            knowledge built using more data.

          <h2>Surveying</h2>
          <p>
            Almost all phenomena that affect human beings occur on the Earth's surface. Therefore, ahving knowledge of the where
            these phenomena occurs provides kniwledge of why, how, where and even when they could occur. This knowledge can be gained by collecting
            data on positions within the Earth's surface.

            <p>
              This SDI geo-portal was developed for coordinating data collection and sharing amongst disaster management organizations in
              Kenya, simulating how users will be able to share data seamlessly. With the geo-portal, data from organizations doesn't need to be in
              a single spatial database, the databases can be harvested by the SDI periodically. The SDI supports user permissions, multiple users 
              can use the portal at a moment. Details are located at <a href="https://github.com/FRANKSADWAR/SDI-for-Disaster-Management" class="overview">DISASTER SDI KENYA.</a>

            <p>
              The objective of this project was to connect avocado farmers with potential stakeholders in avocado farming, assist farmers in
              delivery of their produce to the pick up locations using shortest route networks and optimizing pickup of their avocado produce
              using service area allocation. Details are located at <a href="https://github.com/FRANKSADWAR/WebGIS-for-Avocado-Farmers" class="overview">Web-GIS-for avocado farmers.</a>

            <h2>Geo-Django, JS, Chart Js, LaefletJS, GeoServer,PostgreSQL, PostGIS, PgRouting</h2>
            <p>
              Geodetic networks in Kenya have for years been troublesome to surveyors and geospatial data managers to locate, finds coordinates thereof, 
              and even use any set of available geodetic points within an area. The portal enables surveyors to know the status of the geodetic networks 
              before they visit the field within a web map. They can be able to know the order of the geodetic networks and access how those networks willbe useful
              to them before going to the field. And while in the field, they can still be able to report on the status on the contol stations which in turn 
              will help other surveyors in their work. Details are located at <a href="https://github.com/FRANKSADWAR/GeodeticNetwork" class="overview">Geodetic Network Kenya.</a>

            <p>
              Road accidents are a menace within the society, despite that, there are reasons why road accidents occur at certain locations and not 
              in other locations, this makes accidents unique in terms of their discrete nature. Using data collected from occurences of road accidents,
              point patterns were investigated to establish interactions such as clustering. The point data was then aggregated into areal units to 
              determine accident hotpots and coldspots.

              Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves extracting useful information from text. Information could be the way 
              people feel, think or even want. From the hotel reviews, the anlysis can be able to classify a certain sentiment as negative or postive.
              From text mining, a customer can be advised on the based hotels to visit and those to avoid on a trip to Europe.
